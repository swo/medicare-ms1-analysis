## Is inpatient care masking our signal?

I wondered if the people who were likely to get the most antibiotics were so
sick that they were in SNF or IP care, and they received their "allotment" of
drugs from that source.

I found that mean abx PDE increased with number of acute IP stays, up until about
10 stays, at which point the data got noisy. Only 371 people had >= 10 stays.

So although this effect might be there, it's such a small number of people
that I didn't worry about it.
